If there is a faster way to create folders in React, then I don't know it and I wasted my time lol. If not, then you're welcome I guess. I hope this helps someone or just future me when I forget to make more copies.

Just a basic React project, but I created a Components, Pages, Animation, and Styling folders. Add this to your editor, save, then create a couple coppies!
